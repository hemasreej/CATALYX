SatNOGS-  is satellite networked open ground station so it is a global open source project that lets anyone Build operate and share a satellite ground station all connected through the Internet.
Basically it is like worldwide network of antennas and radios that can track and receive signals from satellites especially LEO
Imagine hundreds of people around the world each having a small antenna and a receiver they connect their setups to the satnogs network online.
when a satellite passes over one of them the ground station it
    automatically tracks the satellite movement 
    receives signals like telemetry, images, beacon data and
    uploads data to the satnogs database so that everyone can access it publicly
