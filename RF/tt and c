Practical workflow at a TT&C station (step-by-step)

Predict: get current ephemeris/TLE â†’ predict next pass and pointing (az/el vs time).

Schedule: create schedule in the ground software (antenna, receiver, recording, demodulation).

Acquire & track: antenna slews to initial az/el, acquires beacon, and then tracks (closed-loop using received signal strength / feedback from tracking loop).

Record measurements: log carrier frequency, telemetry packets, ranging measurements, timestamps (GPS time).

Process: send raw data to data-reduction center or run orbit-determination locally.

Decide: if orbit error > threshold, plan correction.

Command: send uplink commands (orbit burns, attitude adjustments).

Confirm: verify via post-burn tracking and telemetry.
